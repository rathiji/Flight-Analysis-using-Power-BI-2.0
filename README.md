**Project Brief: Airline Ticket Price Analysis and Visualization**

**Introduction**

The price of an airline ticket is affected by a number of factors, including flight duration, days left before departure, arrival time, and departure time. Airlines may lower prices when they need to build market share or when tickets are less available. They may also raise prices. The price may depend on different factors, and each factor has its own proprietary rules and algorithms for setting the price.

**Business Objectives**

The aviation industry is highly competitive, and airlines are always looking for ways to improve their operations and gain a competitive edge. By analyzing and visualizing flight data using Power BI, airlines can gain insights into their performance and identify areas for improvement. These insights can help airlines improve operational efficiency, enhance passenger satisfaction, and increase revenue.

**Learning Goals**

The goal of this project is to develop proficiency in data analysis and visualization using Power BI. The project will cover the following learning goals:

* Learn to work with large and complex datasets from the aviation industry
* Develop skills in data cleaning, transformation, and manipulation
* Learn to identify patterns and trends in flight data, and derive insights to improve airline operations

**Expected Outcomes**

The expected outcomes of this project are:

* A comprehensive understanding of the factors that affect airline ticket prices
* The ability to use Power BI to analyze and visualize flight data
* The ability to identify patterns and trends in flight data, and derive insights to improve airline operations

**Project Timeline**

The project will be completed over a period of 12 weeks. The following is a tentative schedule:

* Week 1: Introduction to the project and Power BI
* Weeks 2-4: Data collection and cleaning
* Weeks 5-7: Data analysis and visualization
* Weeks 8-10: Identifying patterns and trends
* Weeks 11-12: Presenting findings and recommendations

**Project Deliverables**

The following deliverables are expected at the end of the project:

* A final report that summarizes the findings of the project
* A presentation that communicates the findings of the project to a wider audience
* A working Power BI dashboard that can be used by airlines to analyze and visualize flight data

**Conclusion**

This project has the potential to make a significant contribution to the aviation industry. By developing proficiency in data analysis and visualization using Power BI, airlines can gain insights into their performance and identify areas for improvement. These insights can help airlines improve operational efficiency, enhance passenger satisfaction, and increase revenue.
